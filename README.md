# CaneCryption

My Own Very Simple Text Encryption/Decryption Program.  


## How to Encrypt?

- If you want to encrypt your message, make sure you input "E", "e", or even the word "encrypt" when prompted with the question "Do you want to Encrypt or decrypt?".
- Then input your "plain-text" message when prompted with the question "What is your message?".
- Then BOOM! Your input is encrypted using the CaneCryption.

## How to Decrypt?

- If you want to decrypt your message, make sure you input "D", "d", or even the word "decrypt" when prompted with the question "Do you want to Encrypt or decrypt?".
- Then input the "encrypted text" when prompted with the question "What is your message?".

## What is Plain-text & Encrypted Text?

- Plain-text is regular writing that anyone can easily read.
- Encrypted text is secret writing that's scrambled and needs a special code to be understood.

## To Run This Program

- Simply run the program and follow the prompts to either encrypt or decrypt your messages.
